# Note on UI Functions

The new landing page should include similar or better interactive UI functions as the original, such as:
- Hero section with switchable banners (slider)
- Achievements/certifications carousel (sliding, more than 3 certs)
- Flip-flop animations for cards or images

These features will enhance user experience and maintain consistency with the original site.

## Image Handling Approach

For images in the new landing page, we'll use:
- **Placeholder sections** with clear instructions for each image type
- **Proper alt text** describing what should be there
- **Correct dimensions** based on the layout
- **Easy-to-find markers** like `<!-- REPLACE: Description -->`

**Image categories to handle:**
- Certification badges (ACEA, ACEP, ACCA)
- Client logos (Petronas, Maxis, etc.)
- Product graphics (security, networking diagrams)
- Company logos (ACE Team branding)
- Assessment/promotional images

**Example placeholder:**
```html
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Aruba ACEA Certification Badge" class="cert-badge">
<!-- REPLACE: Upload ACEA certification image here -->
```

This approach allows easy identification and replacement of each image with actual assets.
